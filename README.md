### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was looking to develop their game which was a take on win lose or draw. They wanted the game to be a multiplayer experience for a browser based game. The client was looking for a full layout of what the best practices would be to develop, deploy, and manage their game. 

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In this documentation I would say I did a great job at breaking down some of the more complex items. Breaking down the different platforms and how they would benefit or hinder the Gaming Room as a client was something I felt I did exceedingly well on. 

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The best part of working from this document was that it was all laid out for me. There was requirements that needed to be met, and it was clear and concise what was required of me. 

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would choose to improve the depth of which I went into with my recommendations. I think that given more space and time to research there could be a more well thought out and put together assessment. 

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user had a clear thoughout process that they wanted to use. They wanted a multiplayer, multiteam game. This meant that the design had to follow a singleton pattern based on the requirements sent from the client. It was important to consider the user's needs because if the wrong software design pattern was used the application wouldn't work as efficiently. 

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approach this design with an open mind. I was willing to look into the different options and research them fully to make sure I was making the correct choice. I would use the singleton pattern in the future for any application that would require a similar operation for a game.
